# The agent's mission loop, end-to-end on real gfx1201 silicon:
#   DETECT the GPU -> SCAN the ISA (assembler ground truth) -> FIND a gap
#   -> FIX it (write the kernel) -> VALIDATE (bit-exact vs CPU) -> MEASURE
#   -> then CHECK THE MEASUREMENT ITSELF, which is where most speedup claims die.

echo "  The silicon has v_dot8_i32_iu4: 8 int4 values in ONE instruction."
echo "  => the shipped kernel leaves the native path unused. That is the gap."

echo "  Both kernels above are one-thread-per-row, so adjacent lanes land"
echo "  K/2 bytes apart — uncoalesced. At 28 MiB the 64 MiB Infinity Cache"
