chat_session.py — a real multi-turn conversation with Hyperloom.

Everything here happens live: the brain is Qwen-AgentWorld-35B-A3B served by
Lemonade on the Radeon card, the tools actually execute on this machine, and
each turn carries the previous turns' context so the agent can build on what it
already established.

Nothing is scripted on the model's side. The user turns are fixed so the demo is
reproducible; every assistant turn, tool call and tool result is produced live.

Tools the agent may call:
  scan_isa    probe the target with llvm-mc and report whether an instruction
              is really present (the assembler cannot lie)
  read_kernel show the dispatch site of a kernel so it can see for itself
              which route is used
  run_bench   build and run a correctness-gated benchmark on the GPU
