generate_narration.py — the LOCAL model writes its own voiceover, grounded.

The Track 1 claim for this submission is that the artifact is produced by the
stack it demonstrates. So the narration script is written by the agent's own
brain (Qwen-AgentWorld-35B-A3B via Lemonade on the R9700), not by a human and
not by a cloud model. kokoro-v1 then speaks it. Both on the same card.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES: asked from memory, local models here confidently got
RDNA4 facts wrong (two separate models described `iu4` as 8-bit and as 16-bit;
it is 4-bit). So the model is never asked to recall anything. It is handed the
segment's ACTUAL terminal transcript and told to describe what is on screen.

AND THE GUARD: every number the model emits is checked against the transcript.
If it produces a figure that is not on screen, the line is REJECTED. A narration
that states a number the video does not show is exactly the failure this project
spent the day removing.

Usage: python3 generate_narration.py [segment ...]   -> writes narration-cues.json
