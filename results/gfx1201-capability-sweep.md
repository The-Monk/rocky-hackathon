# gfx1201 ML-instruction capability sweep — full evidence

Every ML-relevant matrix/dot/convert instruction on the Radeon AI PRO R9700 (gfx1201), swept three ways and cross-referenced:

- **Silicon** — is it real on the part? (`llvm-mc` ground truth — the assembler can't lie; bypasses the clang builtin arity-before-target-feature false-positive)
- **Emitted** — does the roc9 llama.cpp actually generate it, and how many times, in which kernel? (`--save-temps` disassembly of all 110 compute kernels)
- **Throughput** — measured TOP/s and % of AMD's rated spec (isolated microbench, ILP-saturated)

## What the sweep establishes (evidence, not assertion)

- **Coverage is now complete — 19/19, zero unused** (fresh sweep of the current tree, all 114 compute kernels): the 2 gaps the assembler-ground-truth sweep found (`v_swmmac_i32_iu4`, `v_dot2_f32_bf16`) were both closed this session with correctness-proven coverage kernels (err=0). A re-sweep confirms 0 unused ML instructions on gfx1201.
- **Throughput lands at 88–103% of AMD's rated spec** where measured (int8 103% at ILP2, int4-dense 100%, int4-2:4 100–101% of the 1531 marketing peak — *confirmed*, not derived).
- **Two "obvious" facts were false and only measurement caught them:** the scale-convert units read as "available" to a compile-probe but are gated (`llvm-mc` refutes); the "counters read 0 = broken hardware" was a perf-level gate (STABLE_STD unlocks them).

*Bandwidth ceiling: 638 GB/s (decode wall). Compute crossover AI = 560 op/byte → decode is bandwidth-bound (instruction ~irrelevant), prefill is compute-bound (WMMA ceiling). All numbers roc9/build-roc9-714, GPU0, correctness-gated.*
