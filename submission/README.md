## About the demo video

`demo-operation.mp4` is a **genuine screen capture of the system running**, not a rendered
animation or a replay of stored text. It records `demo/run_demo.sh` executing live against the
R9700 — every command shown being typed is the command that runs, and every number on screen is
produced on the card during the recording.

Reproduce the recording yourself:

```bash
./demo/run_demo.sh                 # run the workflow directly
PACE=6 POST=16 ./demo/capture_demo.sh   # or re-record the video
```

The capture runs on a virtual X display (`Xvfb :99`) so it does not depend on a desktop session;
compute runs on GPU0.

**What the video shows, in order:** detect the silicon → scan the ISA with the assembler as ground
truth → identify the unused native instruction → build both routes and prove which instruction
each emits → correctness-gate bit-exact against a CPU reference → measure → **audit the
measurement itself** → the DRAM-honest production result → prefill → comms.

Step 5 is the one worth watching. The agent deliberately re-runs its own benchmark at a
cache-resident working set so the harness prints `125% of roofline (CACHE-RESIDENT!)` — a
bandwidth above the DRAM roofline is proof that cache was measured, not memory. It then shows the
DRAM-honest number, 97% of roofline. This caught a real error in an earlier version of this
submission, where the decode benchmark had been reporting 122% of roofline as if it were a win.

`demo-hq.mp4` is a shorter 51-second title/intro piece, also produced entirely on the same card
(kokoro-v1 narration, Flux-2-Klein-9B imagery, via Lemonade). It is supplementary; the operation
capture above is the submission video.

## Verification

All headline numbers were re-verified from a **clean clone of the public repository**, on the
card, on 2026-08-04:

```
decode   613 GB/s = 97% of the measured 631 GB/s DRAM roofline   max_rel_err=1.1e-04 PASS
prefill  3.669x @ K=8192                                          all gates max_abs_err=0 PASS
comms    INT6 mean rel_l2=0.0239, 2.46x compression vs fp16
```

Per-claim reproduction commands are in [`benchmarks/README.md`](../benchmarks/README.md).
