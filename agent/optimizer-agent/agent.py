optimizer-agent — a private, fully-local AI agent that tunes LLM inference on AMD Radeon (RDNA4).

Architecture (JM constraint: "it has to fit on one card, testing the other"):
  - BRAIN: a local tool-calling model served by lemonade, pinned to ONE card (fits in 32GB).
  - BENCH: the agent's tools run REAL benchmarks on the OTHER card, isolated (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES),
           so measurements are never corrupted by the brain's own inference.
  - PLUGGABLE: an optimization "task" = (knowledge it was given + tools + goal). Swap the task to
           tune a different lever (DFlash depth, rpb, quant choice, ...) or target different hardware.

The brain never guesses numbers — it can only learn by calling tools that measure on real silicon.
This is the whole thesis: the agent optimizes inference by running experiments, exactly like the
earlier assisted session that produced the 2.34x DFlash result — but now on a local model, on-device.

Run:  python3 agent.py --task dflash_depth
